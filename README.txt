Acme ANS, Inc.

This is an initial project based on the fictitious company Acme AirNav Solutions, Inc. (Acme ANS, Inc.), 
which is dedicated to providing software resources, specifically a WIS, to airports. These resources will 
help airports manage their own resources and coordinate operations. In summary, helping them with the logistics of charter flights.

The scope of this project includes flight scheduling, booking management, crew management, incident reporting and 
resolution, as well as aircraft maintenance. 

It is intended to be a core learning asset for the students
who have enrolled the Design and Testing subject of the Software Engineering curriculum of the 
University of Seville.  This project helps them start working on their new information system 
projects.
